        <h2>Game Concept</h2>
          <p>In this game our main character will be a ball. The game view will be in Third person Player (TPP) mode. This game will have several levels. The higher levels will become more difficult than the previous levels. The main concept of the game is that the ball should be able to move through different type of obstacles in order to pass the level. The ball will have three lives for each level.
        <br>
The game concept came through the old Nokia (3310) mobile game bounce which was made in 2D. And was very fun game to play at that time. By keeping that fun in mind we thought of making a similar game in 3D.

          <h2>Genre</h2>
          <p>The genre of this game will be (Arcade, Casual, Offline).</p>
