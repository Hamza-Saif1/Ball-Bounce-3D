        <br>
The game concept came through the old Nokia (3310) mobile game bounce which was made in 2D in black and white color combination. And was very fun game to play at that time. By keeping that fun in mind, we thought of making a similar game in 2D, but using colorful modern assets that can be fun to play for users and remind them of old days in which they used to play this game.
